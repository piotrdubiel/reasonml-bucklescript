# ReasonML + BuckleScript = ðŸŽ‰

## Javascript is great, because of ecosystem & tools, not because itâ€™s maintainable out-of-the-box

## Two approaches

- Flowtype & Typescript
- Elm, ClojureScript, PureScript

## Types are useful

- when composing curried functions it's easy to make a mistake

## React is functional

- components as functions of state
- preferably immutable
- declarative
- emphasis on first-class and higher-order functions

## BuckleScript

### Bloomberg

### BuckleScript

### Why OCaml

- Sound type system.
- Strong type inference.
- Expressive type features, like variants, modules & objects.

### BuckleScript features

- dead code elimination,
- compile-time optimizations,
- readable & tiny JS output,
- preservation of code structure,
- fast iteration loop,

## Syntax

### Pattern matching

### Modules

### Currying

### Mutations
